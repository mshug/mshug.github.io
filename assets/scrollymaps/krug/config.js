As the three maps of internet availability by household income show, the real problem lies not with geographic restrictions and low density - but rather by the affordability of internet. Here, lower incomes are at a disadvantage throughout the state, both in urban and rural areas. The higher income map proves that internet is in general available everywhere in the state - even in Appalachia.</p><p style="fontweight=bold; font=serif"> This means that internet is generally available, it is just not affordable for all economic groups. And since the Appalachian region has disproportionately more poverty and lower incomes, this results in an overall higher number of no internet access.</p> For a region that has already been struggling before the downfall of the coal industry, it is now more important than ever to bring affordable internet to these communities. If the counties in question do not find ways to improve broadband access for citizens and companies, the decline of jobs and rise of socio-economic problems will only become worse. The Appalachian region in Kentucky is at risk of going down a spiral of decay. Leaving improvements to private companies does not appear to be a valid solution.',
